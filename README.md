# Delaunay
Delaunay is a triangulation software application that builds different type of triangulations and obtains other diagrams that
can be built using those triangulations as the basis for the building process.

The center triangulation implemented is the Delaunay triangulation. This type of triangulations are suitable for many real 
world applications: location points, modelling surfaces and others.

Some of the diagrams that can be easily obtained from the Delaunay triangulation are Voronoi diagram, Gabriel graph, convex hull of a set of points and many others.

This tool is in continuos evolution and new features area added periodically.
